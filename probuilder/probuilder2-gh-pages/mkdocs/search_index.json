Right Handed  OBJ, PLY  Unity's coordinate system is \"Left Handed\", where most other major 3D modeling packages operate in \"Right Handed\" coordinates.    Copy Textures  OBJ  If enabled the exporter will copy texture maps to the OBJ file destination and reference them from local paths in the material library. If unchecked the material library will reference an absolute path to the textures and not copy them. If you're exporting an OBJ to use in Unity leave this unchecked and set the Mesh Importer \"Material Naming\" to \"From Model's Material\" and \"Material Search\" to \"Project-Wide.\"    Vertex Colors  OBJ  Some 3D modeling applications can import vertex colors from an unofficial extension to the OBJ format. Toggling this will write vertex colors using the MeshLab format. This can break import in some applications, please use with caution!    Texture Scale, Offset  OBJ  Some 3D modeling applications import texture scale and offset paramters (Blender, for example). Toggling this will write these values to the exported mtlib file. This can break import in some applications, please use with caution!    STL Format  STL  The STL file specification supports both ASCII and Binary representations.
